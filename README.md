This is a simple and responsive To-Do List application built with React. It allows users to:
Add new tasks
Edit existing tasks
Delete tasks
Prevent blank tasks from being added
The app uses React Hooks (useState) to manage the task list and editing state. It's styled with a custom CSS file and provides a clean, user-friendly interface for managing daily tasks efficiently.
